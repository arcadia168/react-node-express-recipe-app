# The solution

See the solution running on Azure App Service: http://***REMOVED***-***REMOVED***-react-express-recipe-app.azurewebsites.net/home/

Run the project locally:
* Run 'npm install'
* Run the server and app: 'npm start' and visit 'http://localhost:3000/home'
* Run client side tests: 'npm test'
* Run server side tests: 'mocha'

# The challenge

The application is a food / recipe application that will help users
become better at cooking. Unfortunately the product manager has dumped
a bunch of specifications on you and done a runner!
